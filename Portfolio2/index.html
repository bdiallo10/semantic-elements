        <h2>The Problem is</h2>
        <p>When it comes to maximizing revenue in the workplace,
          very often scholars and executives talks about strategy,
          structure, and processes. There is less or no focus on
          how to reduce stress and workload for employees as a way
          to increase productivity and maximizing revenue. For example,
          in the service industries, there’s always requiring overtime,
          high expectation and pushing a sales cultures to maximize
          revenue especially in busy seasons. While all these processes
          and strategies can help companies generate more revenue,
          it is also important to recognize the negative impact
          employees have to endures as well as the potential lost
          revenue that a company will insure due to stress. The
          American Institutes of Stress (2007) reported that the
          US Industries lost 300 billion dollars a year due to stress.
          Most of the common effects of stress are: accidents,
          absenteeism, employee turnover and lack productivity,
          as well as direct medical, legal and insurance costs
          to business owners. I believe with more professional
          development in the areas of effective leadership and
          communication, US Industries can decrease the amount of
          money that are being forfeited due to stress and at the
          same time maximize revenues in the long-term. </p>

      <h2>Due to Lack of Stress Free Leadership</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>US Industries lost 300 billion dollars a year due to stress</li>
        <li>The Ken Blanchard Company (2009) did a study titled
          “The High Cost of Doing Nothing: Quantifying the Impact of
          Leadership on the Bottom Line” in which they found that
          the average company is forfeiting $1 million per year in
          untapped potentials. </li>
        <li>Tor Dahl, former president of the World Confederation of
          Productivity Science and a member of the Board of Directors
          for the American Productivity and Quality Center, reported
          that “...each individual in an organization can still increase
          productivity by at least 30%” if the company and organization
          have a more optimal leadership.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, a calculation done by Development Dimension
          International (DDI), which is a corporate organization that
          help businesses develop leaders, found out that one
          incompetent leader can cost a company $126,000 a year. </li>
        <li>Additionally, Smart CEO reported that: Less-than-optimal
          leadership practices cost the typical organization an
          amount equal to as much as 7% of their total annual sales.
          At least 9% and possibly as much as 32% of an organization’s
          voluntary turnover can be avoided through better leadership
          skills. Better leadership can generate a 3 - 4% improvement
          in customer satisfaction scores and a corresponding 1.5%
          increase in revenue growth.</li>
